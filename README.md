The current automotive industry faces increased pressure from shorter product 
development cycles, intensified market competition, and rapid technological 
advancements. A key driver of this transformation is the rising significance of software 
integration and interconnected systems, leading to complex and heterogeneous IT 
architectures. This transformation is particularly evident with the advent of software
defined vehicles (SDVs), which rely heavily on software for core functionalities, 
continuous updates, and performance enhancements. Consequently, managing and 
analysing log files generated from various software components within intelligent vehicle 
fleets becomes critical, yet increasingly challenging as these contain valuable diagnostic 
information. This thesis aims to develop an advanced log analysis pipeline leveraging 
Large Language Models (LLMs) to enhance real-time diagnostics and anomaly detection 
within intelligent vehicle fleets. 
In this work, a comprehensive log analysis solution based on the RAG strategy and multi
agent architecture is developed and implemented. The proposed system efficiently 
processes real-time logs generated by a Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) performing 
automated valet parking tasks within a virtual environment created using ROS2 and 
Gazebo simulator. Logs from diverse sources, including software-level, hardware-level, 
and services interactions, are systematically analysed to identify anomalies and generate 
detailed diagnostic summaries. Specifically, the implemented multi-agent RAG pipeline 
classifies source of errors, identifies root causes of faults, and provides actionable 
recommendations for system improvement.
